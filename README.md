# nixconf
My personal NixOS Configuration and various other dotfiles and helpers.
Feel free to fork.

## install.hs
A little helper script that can be used to update configuration.nix and to symlink dotfiles to their respective targets.
(NOTE: Written in Haskell. Needs GHC and Turtle to work properly!)
